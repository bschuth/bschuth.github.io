    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I haven&rsquo;t been in college for decades, but I always feel as though I should be returning to school in September. Looking at where I am at this point in my life, what courses should I be taking?</p>
<p>For work, I am about to make a transition to C++, and I&rsquo;m struggling with questions about the design of the platform I have to live in. In my personal life, I&rsquo;ve used this unusual year to get myself into better running and biking shape than I have been in before, and don&rsquo;t want to lose that. Also, I made progress in returning to my study of ancient Greek, but am currently stalled.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say three classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Up to Speed With C++</em>, a mostly lab-based practical class where you work through examples from tutorial texts, and perhaps address some algorithmic problems.</li>
<li><em>Physical Education: Endurance</em>, which is just my current run/bike schedule (I&rsquo;m hoping to perhaps run the <a href="https://millinocketmarathon.com/">Millinocket Half-Marathon</a> in December, or perhaps will do a long bike ride around the Columbus Day week I am taking off).</li>
<li><em>Intensive Ancient Greek</em>: Working my way through Hansen and Quinn again, with the aim to quickly get to reading Plato&rsquo;s <em>Ion</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Greek class is something of a re-take of the class I took in 1988, but this time I really hope to master it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need for a more detailed syllabus here; but the <em>Up to Speed With C++</em> needs a list of text books. I think I just need two, both of which I&rsquo;m reading through the <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com">O&rsquo;Reilly Learning</a> site. I was fortunate to lock in a fairly cheap lifetime rate many years back when they were struggling so I&rsquo;m not paying quite what they demand now. Compared to what I was spending back in the old days on computer books, it&rsquo;s a spectacular deal:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>C++ Cookbook</em>, a type-along tutorial book that gives me the kind of mechnical work that makes theory and concepts turn into something usable and practical;</li>
<li><em>The C++ Programming Language (Fourth Edition)</em> by the redoubtable Bjarne Stroustrup; if I can&rsquo;t figure out C++ from that, I should think twice about trying it, because that really is the Bible of the language; and</li>
<li>Selections from <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> by Donald Knuth. OK, this kind of a lie and/or cheat. I bought these books years ago and once or twice a year I try to read them, but they are a formidable adversary. It&rsquo;s not enough that the concepts are expressed in assembly language, but they are in an imagined assembly language of Knuth&rsquo;s own design (and there&rsquo;s a 64-bit version being developed now). Also, I&rsquo;m not proud to confess that proof by induction has never felt fluent to me; so of course he makes it the cornerstone of the introduction to the book. Oh, and the first 230 pages of the 630 page first volume are on &ldquo;mathematical preliminaries.&rdquo; Nevertheless I&rsquo;m going to try to use it as a source book for things to play around with in C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I need some sort of schedule for C++ and Greek, to give some idea of my strategy.</p>
