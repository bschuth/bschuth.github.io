<p>Here&rsquo;s how I got here. I was on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and went to a blog entry entitled <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2020-09.html#e2020-09-22T16_09_19.htm">&ldquo;Time Spent Programming Is Often Time Well Spent&rdquo;</a> by Eugene Wallingford, a computer science professor in Iowa. Next to that was the post I <a href="http://bschuth.github.io/plans/books-to-read/">mention in my book list</a>, which took me to <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org">The Paris Review</a>. That made me want to subscribe to The Paris Review, and to pull Wally Shawn&rsquo;s plays off my shelf again, I think <em>The Designated Mourner</em> might be a little scary to read at this point in time.</p>
<p>There is a different link in Wallingford&rsquo;s blog article to <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com">Scholar&rsquo;s Stage</a>, a very long article that starts with a quote from Marc Andreesen, so big whoop, but Wallingford isolates a quote about needing a &ldquo;society awash in mediocre&hellip;poetry&rdquo; to be able to create brilliant poets. I&rsquo;m not at all interested in the article beyond that, but the right side of the screen is filled with links to other places, one of them, <a href="https://sententiaeantiquae.com">Sententiae Antiquae</a> is a &ldquo;commonplace book&rdquo; of quotes from Latin and Greek authors, so that&rsquo;s right up my alley too. I did not know that they were part of the <a href="https://sententiaeantiquae.com/reading-greek-tragedy-online/">Reading Greek Tragedy Online</a> project that I was aware of by being on the mailing list of <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu">Harvard&rsquo;s Center for Hellenic Studies</a>. And now I have to go back and watch those. At some point I&rsquo;ll go back to Scholar&rsquo;s Stage and follow other links as well, but <em>vita brevis.</em></p>
<p>I got onto the <a href="https://fivebooks.com">Five Books</a> site by following another Wallingford link - this one about science fiction and <a href="https://git-scm.org">git</a> metaphors. I ended up on a page entitled &ldquo;The best books on Philosophical Wonder.&rdquo; Ick. But then I saw links to other, more promising lists, and I lost an hour. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about Five Books. There&rsquo;s something middlebrow and leading about the &ldquo;interviews&rdquo; - &ldquo;middlebrow&rdquo; in that the format seems calculated to be &ldquo;unintimidating&rdquo; and chatty and ends up being long-winded and something to skim, not read. &ldquo;Middlebrow&rdquo; also in that even in philosophy lists, where you might expect the reader might welcom some challenge, there&rsquo;s this constant drumbeat about readability, accessibility, and practical applications. &ldquo;Leading&rdquo; in that there&rsquo;s a fawning attitude towards the people who provided the books, and a vague sense that the &ldquo;interview&rdquo; questions were perhaps negotiated ahead of time. <a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/ralph-waldo-emerson-james-marcus/">James Marcus on Emerson</a> made me temporarly uninterested in an author I have read with pleasure for decades. This despite the first book on the list being Richardson&rsquo;s biography, a book I love. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv7jcciKB_s">To be fair,</a> I did learn that Ellen, Emerson&rsquo;s doomed first wife, left behind love letters that have been published separately; Emerson&rsquo;s side of the correspondence has not survived. There&rsquo;s been one little thing I take away from each of these - and packaged lists of philosophy books do seem to seduce me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the lists I looked at today, and what I took away from them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually I did find myself intrigued by Zuangzi on the &ldquo;Philosophical Wonder&rdquo; page. So sue me. And I guess I was happy to see Montaigne there (one of Emerson&rsquo;s heroes, BTW).</li>
<li><a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/critical-thinking-nigel-warburton/">Critical Thinking</a>. Actually also ick. Five of these books that fill up Amazon bookstores, &ldquo;science&rdquo; about how to do things better.</li>
<li><a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/best-philosophy-books-2017/">Best Philosophy books of 2017</a> - <em>The Meaning of Belief</em>, which sounds like it might be chiming with embryonic ideas I have about our historical moment and the need to fill ethical vacuums.</li>
<li><a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/philosophy-summer-reading-2019-nigel-warburton/">Summer Philosophy Reading - 2019</a>. Oh, ick again, that title. And <em>The Path</em>&rsquo;s subtitle, &ldquo;A New Way to Think About Everything&rdquo;, also ick. But that book, based on a Harvard class I vaguely heard about, sounds worth pursuing.</li>
<li><a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/philosophy-2019-nigel-warburton/">Best Philosophy Books of 2019</a>. Here&rsquo;s the opening paragraphs of the &ldquo;interview&rdquo; of this one. You&rsquo;ll either find this nice and informal and &ldquo;unintimidating&rdquo;, or a weird,  prolix and apparently un-edited evasive excuse for not actually choosing the best philosophy books of 2019:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously I can’t read all the philosophy books that come out, but the ones that I’ve read have been really exciting. There’s been quite a wide range published and some excellent books. I found it quite difficult to choose just five, which is probably a good sign.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In these interviews I try to select books that I think will be of interest to a general reader, rather than somebody who’s an academic specialist in philosophy. There are books that have been published this year that are going to be important in their field, which are very much academic monographs. I haven’t included those. Philosophy publishing is broader than the area I’ve selected from.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But in terms of books that are designed to appeal to a wide readership—which don’t presuppose knowledge of philosophy or at least not extensive knowledge of philosophy—there have been some outstanding ones and we’ll get on to those.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ll stop there, you get the idea. Some books might appear over on my book list from this. But I&rsquo;ll always feel a little dirty.</p>
<p>Finally, Wallingford also mentions a couple of other technical books I find intriguing. <a href="https://sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 Bottles of OOP</a> by Sandy Metz sounds like a great book to read in conjunction with Robert Martin&rsquo;s book <em>Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#</em>. Metz' book covers similar ground (SOLID principles, etc.) but I&rsquo;d like to hear another voice doing it. I attended a live remote training with Martin on O&rsquo;Reilly a few weeks back and found him almost impossible to listen to, and now his vocal delivery infects the words on the page&hellip;</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a> by Bob Nystrom (you can actually read the book online at that link). As a self-taught and not terribly systematic programmer, one thing I have never really mastered is writing a compiler/interpreter, even in its simplest form. Back in the day I struggled mightily with the Lex/Yacc bird book, and got to the point where I understood lex pretty well, but never got to the end of the process. Wallingford sends you there because of this passage in the introduction, which again chimes with some things I&rsquo;ve been working over in my head lately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made this problem harder for myself because of the meta-goal I had. One reason I didn&rsquo;t get into languages until later in my career was because I was intimidated by the reputation compilers have as being only for hardcore computer science wizard types. I&rsquo;m a college dropout, so I felt I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough, or at least wasn&rsquo;t educated enough to hack it. Eventually I discovered that those barriers existed only in my mind and that anyone can learn this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to do one bit of work that is something more than consuming other people&rsquo;s writing&hellip;Sententiae Antiquae has two mottoes, one Latin, one Greek. The Greek one is &ldquo;ΕΥΔΟΞΑ ΑΓΝΩΣΤΑ ΚΑΤΑΓΕΛΑΣΤΑ&rdquo;, or &ldquo;εὔδοξα ἄγνωστα καταγέλαστα&rdquo;, which I believe means &ldquo;the highly esteemed, the unknown, the ridiculous.&rdquo; I am glad to have learned the Greek work for &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; today.</p>
