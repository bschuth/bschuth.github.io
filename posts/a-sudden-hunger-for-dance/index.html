    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Last week I suddenly watched a lot of dance, via a roundabout inspiration. My brother asked me for some suggestions about pieces by Philip Glass that might interest his son.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about Glass again, which got me thinking about Steve Reich, and thinking about Reich reminded me of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i36Qhn7NhoA">piece that the Dutch choreographer Anna Teresa de Keersmaeker created using Reich&rsquo;s <em>Violin Phase</em>.</a>. That also got me thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb2f_-m7iM">Lucinda Child&rsquo;s choreography for Glass' <em>Einstein on the Beach</em>,</a> which totally hypnotized me when I saw that work at BAM back in the 1990s. (The <em>Einstein</em> video is pretty terrible, clearly taken illegally during a performance in Mexico City.)</p>
<p>Then I told a friend about this and showed him de Keersmaeker&rsquo;s video, and we both thought of Wim Wender&rsquo;s <em>Pina</em>. We had both seen it when we came out. Originally intended to be a documentary about Pina Bausch&rsquo;s work, it changed dramatically when Bausch died. It consists almost entirely of fragments of her work, performed both on stage and in public environments around the city of Wuppertal where her company was based. We also found out we had both made a point of attending the <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3927">Judson Dance Theater exhibition at MOMA</a> at the end of 2018. Judson had a lot to do with the genesis of Viewpoints, which I studied for three weeks about 15 years ago at SITI company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a ton of dance suddenly in my consciousness. I have never felt competent to talk about dance. I had no exposure to any serious dance during my formative years (which were going on until at least 30), and I feel a lack of depth in my visual understanding. I have never been very drawn to visual art, and when I have I find myself reacting to relatively unsubtle work. I remember attending a Mondrian show at the Metropolitan where what made the most impression was an octagonal room with four &ldquo;lozenge&rdquo; (i.e. diamond) shaped canvases. Each of them had nothing but a handful of black straight lines on a white background. But something about the way they hung in that room and faced each other struck me, and I stood there for a very long time before I felt I could move. (The internet is getting to be a little scary. This exhibition was in 1995, twenty-five long years ago (it feels like yesterday), but never the less you can now see <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/470?installation_image_index=32">two</a> <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/470?installation_image_index=33">photos</a> that show you just what I saw that day. It&rsquo;s a little disturbing to note that my memory was that all of the lozenges had just two lines on them; as you can see, only one of them was that spare: one had three, and two had four.)</p>
<p>Rabbit holes on rabbit holes. While writing this piece MOMA offered me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ud1aZFE0fU">this &ldquo;flying train&rdquo; video</a>, which shows the train system in Wuppertal, which plays a significant part in <em>Pina</em>. Then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQH4TS01Jt4">a documentary made by Wuppertaler Stadtwerke about the train</a>, which includes a ridiculous story of a circus elephant forced on to the train who somehow jumped out and landed in the river without injury (there&rsquo;s a horrifying picture of the elephant exiting into the abyss at about 4:20 of the video). Kudos to Germany for acknowledging a couple of serious accidents - and the deterioration that had occurred to the system. They did a major rebuild that completed in 2016, and there&rsquo;s been other improvements since. At its best, Germany looks like what I would like to think modern Western civilization should look like. That spins me into some historical meditations that had better wait for some other time.</p>
<p>The shots of the railway over what looks like a traffic circle in <em>Pina</em> somehow connected me to some shots from Wender&rsquo;s <em>Wings of Desire</em> - something about how the camera moved around the dead space near the Berlin Wall, perhaps? Something else to watch.</p>
<p>I started this post planning to talk about dance, and the use of space, and how Bausch&rsquo;s work as seen in <em>Pina</em> exemplifies and undermines the idea that &ldquo;dance is just staging with music&rdquo;. Instead let this stand as a example of a kind of mental wandering that afflicts me regularly, and perhaps I will return to it at a later time.</p>
