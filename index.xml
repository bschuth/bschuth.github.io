      <description>If I were to create more &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; of my own devising, here&amp;rsquo;s my list of what I want to address:
 Learning Clojure (with SICP as a secondary text) Greek Tragedy (focus on reading Greek, but with practical additions. One tragedy at a time.) Software Architecture Lit Review (how to consolidate all those books and all that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over all this time?) German for Bach Cantatas (supports the yearly listening, simple way to absorb a sub-vocabulary of German)  </description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in college for decades, but I always feel as though I should be returning to school in September. Looking at where I am at this point in my life, what courses should I be taking?
For work, I am about to make a transition to C++, and I&amp;rsquo;m struggling with questions about the design of the platform I have to live in. In my personal life, I&amp;rsquo;ve used this unusual year to get myself into better running and biking shape than I have been in before, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose that.</description>

      <title>Rabbit Hole with Dance</title>

      <description>Last week I suddenly watched a lot of dance, via a roundabout inspiration. My brother asked me for some suggestions about pieces by Philip Glass that might interest his son.
That got me thinking about Glass again, which got me thinking about Steve Reich, and thinking about Reich reminded me of the piece that the Dutch choreographer Anna Teresa de Keersmaeker created using Reich&amp;rsquo;s Violin Phase.. That also got me thinking about Lucinda Child&amp;rsquo;s choreography for Glass&#39; Einstein on the Beach, which totally hypnotized me when I saw that work at BAM back in the 1990s.</description>

      <description>I expect to place short notes here, something of a public journal. I&amp;rsquo;m writing from Eastport, where the weather took a turn from the feverish to the sharply crisp on Thursday night. As I was struggling to sleep, the north wind suddenly rose up, sounding at first like a locomotive, or the shock wave from an explosion. When it became clear there was no fireball behind the breeze, but instead only colder air, I was able to drift off after wrapping myself more closely in my comforter.</description>
