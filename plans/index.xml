      <description>Oh, my god. This is my biggest problem, the huge list of books that look interesting to me that I want to read.
New Books Titles I&amp;rsquo;ve come across that make me want to read them:
 The Battle of the Classics, Eric Adler, OUP. Saw this in an email from Oxford; as a programmer with a philosophy degree, the father of two English majors, a music major, and the husband of a violin performance major, and a guy who is trying to read ancient Greek in his spare time, justification of education in the humanities is something I care a lot about.</description>

      <description>If I were to create more &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; of my own devising, here&amp;rsquo;s my list of what I want to address:
 Learning Clojure (with SICP as a secondary text) Greek Tragedy (focus on reading Greek, but with practical additions. One tragedy at a time.) Software Architecture Lit Review (how to consolidate all those books and all that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over all this time?) German for Bach Cantatas (supports the yearly listening, simple way to absorb a sub-vocabulary of German)  </description>
